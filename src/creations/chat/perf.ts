/**
 * PerfMonitor — frame / memory telemetry for the streaming benchmark panel.
 *
 * Every rate and cost here is **read from the engine**, not re-derived. Core
 * already measures the same quantities on the render loop it owns
 * (`Scene.frameStats`), so a second estimate maintained out here can only drift
 * from the thing it is trying to report — and it did: this module used to keep
 * its own EMA over `1000 / dt` sampled from `update()`, seeded at a literal 60.
 *
 * Two consequences of that seed, both of which showed on screen:
 *
 * - An `onDemand` scene parks between renders. Every idle gap exceeded the
 *   module's own idle threshold and was discarded, so a panel opened but never
 *   streamed reported the seed verbatim — a hardcoded `60` presented as a
 *   measurement, on a display that may run at any rate.
 * - The peak was a running max that never decayed, so a single coalesced
 *   sub-millisecond frame ratcheted it permanently and dragged the derived
 *   refresh interval and CPU proxy with it.
 *
 * What is measured where:
 *
 * - `fps` / `frameMs` / `frameIntervalMs` come from {@link FrameStats}. `fps` is
 *   the cadence of *rendered* frames and `frameTimeMs` is the wall-clock cost of
 *   the last `render()` pass, so neither is a reciprocal of the other and a
 *   cheap frame on a parked scene no longer reads as a fast one.
 * - `displayHz` is calibrated separately by counting raw `requestAnimationFrame`
 *   ticks, because no engine field can carry it: `frameStats.fps` reports redraw
 *   cadence, and an `onDemand` scene deliberately redraws less often than the
 *   display refreshes. Reporting the panel's real capability needs the rAF rate
 *   itself.
 *
 * Memory is `performance.memory` (Chrome only, non-standard); absent elsewhere
 * and reported as `NaN` rather than a fabricated number.

/**
 * Counts raw `requestAnimationFrame` ticks, continuously, in windows.
 *
 * Deliberately independent of the scene's loop. The engine throttles and skips
 * redraws by design, so measuring redraws cannot recover the panel's rate; this
 * runs its own chain of rAF callbacks.
 *
 * It keeps measuring rather than latching one reading, and that is the point.
 * Until 2026-08-05 calibration ran ONCE from the `PerfMonitor` constructor, set
 * `running = false`, and never ran again — so `DISPLAY` was a reading taken at
 * startup and then asserted for the rest of the session. That is wrong exactly
 * when it matters most: **a saturated main thread depresses rAF cadence
 * indistinguishably from an unfocused window.** Measured with the window focused
 * on its own workspace throughout (`hasFocus: true`, `visibilityState:
 * 'visible'` at every sample):
 *
 *     idle                                  240.2 Hz
 *     main thread blocked ~120 ms/frame       8.3 Hz
 *     after the block is released           240.2 Hz
 *
 * Nothing touched focus. So a panel that calibrated while its own document was
 * busy would report `DISPLAY 8 Hz` forever, and — because {@link PerfSample.fps}
 * is scored as a ratio against it — a genuinely bad frame rate would then be
 * coloured green for matching it.
 *
 * Two rates are therefore reported, because one number cannot carry both facts:
 *
 * - {@link hz} is the panel's *capability*: the fastest window observed. rAF
 *   cannot exceed vsync under default settings, so contention can only ever pull
 *   a window BELOW the true rate — never above it — which makes the maximum the
 *   correct estimator and makes it converge from below as soon as one window
 *   lands on an idle stretch.
 * - {@link currentHz} is the *latest* window: what the page is actually getting
 *   right now. A large gap between the two is starvation, and it is the one
 *   signal a page can legitimately show for it, since `hasFocus()` and
 *   `visibilityState` are unchanged in both the busy and the unfocused case.
